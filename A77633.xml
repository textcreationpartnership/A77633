         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IF thou be a Child of the Church, well taught and trained up in the Knowledge and Obedience of Her Holy Commands and Cuſtomes, I hope theſe Devotions may doe thy Soul ſome Service. If thou be a man of another Soul, I wiſh thee poſſeſſed with a better Spirit. And if without prejudice thou wilt read and well weigh what is written, I am willing to believe thou wilt not be the worſer; nay (by Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing) thy mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be made more Intelligent, and thy Heart more Devout, and ſo, thy Soul much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>The Beſt Spirits which ever Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome had, Thoſe Ancient and Eminent ones (whoſe Profeſsion was to Contemplate Heaven, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170171:49"/> Earth, and their Practice and Buſineſſe to Live to God, and Die for Chriſt) the Holy Champions of Chriſtian Faith, and high Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Holy Life, they did think and finde it good to Appoint and Obſerve theſe Holy Dayes. Of which their Homilies, and Sermons, and Prayers, are their good Evidences, and our great Advantages. Now, if we ſhall with the foot of Pride, ſpurn at what they thought and did, (who are neither greater Wits nor Saints) it were better, if we were more Humble. And if they did ſo Improve thoſe Times and Occaſions to the <hi>Honour</hi> of God, the <hi>Glory</hi> of Religion, the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of Piety, the <hi>Evidencing</hi> of Truth, and <hi>Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> of the Church, it were well, if we would be ſo Zealous. If we dare to Damne them and their Doings for <hi>Superſtitious,</hi> that were ſo High in Gods Favour on earth, and are as High in the Glory of Heaven,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170171:50"/> (Great in His Service and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both), though not in Love to them, for fear of Blaſphemy it would become us well to be more Charitable. If that be all we ſay for our ſelves, that Six Dayes we muſt work by Commandement, and <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie</hi> none without it; this ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies little. For as the Jewes had, Chriſtians may have, other Holy Dayes then the Seventh. And the Firſt which St. <hi>John</hi> calls The<note place="margin">Rev. 1.</note> Lords Day (we miſcall our Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath) hath (though warrant enough elſe without juſt doubt of any) yet no formall, Expreſſe Commandement. Nay, why doe we ordain and obſerve Religious Faſts, &amp; Thanksgivings of our own, with Zeale, inſtead of Scruple, and Barres of all works, and yet upon the Six, not the Firſt Day? If theſe be the beſt Bills and Pleas we have againſt the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but not our own Holy Dayes, to preſſe them no more, but caſt them
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170171:50"/> out, would be more Reaſonable. If we plead the uſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> which retaines and obſerves the Dayes we doe, this is leſſe then nothing. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition is not in the <hi>ſame</hi> Dayes, but their <hi>Different</hi> Doings. Not the <hi>Exempla pro nobis,</hi> but the <hi>Ora pro nobis,</hi> is ill. Not a Memory of the Saints to Gods Glory, but a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip like his Honour. Not to Praiſe His Grace in them, and Pray our Imitation, but to Admire and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate them with Devotion; not to Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memorate Gods Bleſsings by them, but to Conſecrate Altars and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to them. If we would without all blindneſſe of Ignorance or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice diſcern better betwixt white and black (uſe and abuſe) what we ſhew for our cauſe, might be more colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>

                     <p>OF the <hi>Four Secretaries</hi> of Chriſts <hi>Holy Goſpel,</hi> S. <hi>Mark</hi> was one.

                     <p>PRobably the <hi>Plague</hi> was <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>'s Diſeaſe. The <hi>Plaiſter</hi> of<note place="margin">Ver. 22.</note> Figs and the <hi>Boile,</hi> make it gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be the <hi>Peſtilence.</hi> A Raging and Roaring Sickneſſe it was, by the ſhape wherein God appears in it (<hi>As a Lion.</hi>) That did not onely tear the Fleſh, but gnaw the Bones (The cruelleſt Extremity which could be felt or feared, an Angry and a Hungry Lion.) And without all eaſe or intermiſſion too. From morning to night, from night to morning. <hi>From
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:170171:228"/> day unto night, he reckons till mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> it will make not an aſſault and breach, but a prey and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock, an utter ruine, and <hi>abſolute end of him.</hi> (A mortall and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Malady) ſo he reckoned.</p>
                     <p>But without the Lord of Hoſts, the God of Health and Sickneſs. True, the Lion was ſet on by God (<hi>Set thy houſe in order, thou</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>ſhalt die.</hi>) Peremptorily, he <hi>ſhall.</hi> And with a Duplicate, <hi>Thou ſhalt not live;</hi> But taken off too by the ſame Hand (Gods) and the ſame Mouth (the Prophets.) Indeed Gods hand was taken off by <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi>'s. He <hi>weeps,</hi> he <hi>prayes.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven<note place="margin">Ver. 2, 3. Numb. 14. 12. Gen. 32. 28.</note> God Himſelf is conquered by thoſe hands. But not by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ones, but <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s. Who elſe would not take the Lion off?</p>
                     <p>Who would die of Sickneſſe, if Prayers and Tears could make them live? <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s it was that did plead, as well as weep and
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:170171:228"/> pray. That made a <hi>plea</hi> for his life which every one cannot draw. From the goodneſſe of his life, for the Reſpit of his death. <hi>From the uprightneſs of his heart,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 2.</note> for the Preſerving of his life. For Gods Mercy, from his Truth. For a longer courſe on earth, from his <hi>holier</hi> one before heaven. This makes him hope a <hi>Reprieve</hi> from the Sentence of God. That makes him pray for it. And to very happy purpoſe. For though the <hi>Doom</hi> was pronounced <hi>Perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory,</hi> it was meant <hi>Conditionall.</hi> And that <hi>Reſerve</hi> God kept in<note place="margin">Ver. 5.</note> His breaſt, to renue the Kings Leaſe upon that Condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That he ſhould ſo Weep, Pray, and Plead. And the <hi>Belief</hi> of it lived in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s breaſt. He did not <hi>lie</hi> down in deſpaire under the dreadfull Meſſage of his Death, but <hi>raiſeth</hi> up a good Spirit of hope, and from it ſeeks and finds
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:170171:229"/> a <hi>Grant</hi> of life. So the good man ſtrives to have the ſame will with God, and the good God doth pleaſe to have the ſame mind with him. And a Bleſſed meeting is made of their minds and wills, as if both had but one Boſom and Heart.</p>

Not fret at it, but weep. Not queſtion, but plead to the Bill. Not ſlight, but peruſe the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>
                     <p>And before the ſad Meſſenger or Meſſage of Death ſhall come, let my Cordiall be ready.
